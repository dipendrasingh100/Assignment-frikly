            <p class="cat-description">
              Laminates are available in various types, each with its unique
              features and uses. Some of the common types of laminates are:
              <br /><br />
              High-Pressure Laminate (HPL) <br />
              High-pressure laminate is one of the most popular types of
              laminates which are crafted by stacking multiple layers of kraft
              paper infused with phenolic resin and further covered with a
              decorative layer. The layered Kraft stack is then compressed under
              high heat and pressure. HPL laminates are chosen for their
              durability, scratch resistance, and impact resistance and are
              mostly preferred for making it suitable for high-traffic areas and
              commercial applications.
              <br /><br />
              Low-Pressure Laminate (LPL) <br />
              Low-pressure laminates are manufactured at lower pressures and
              temperatures. It comprised multiple layers of kraft paper infused
              with melamine resin and a decorative layer as a surface. LPL is
              added to furniture surfaces and other applications where high
              durability is not a prime concern.
              <br /><br />
              Post-Forming Laminate <br />
              Post-forming laminate is a type of High-Pressure Laminate or
              Low-Pressure Laminate that can be moulded or transformed into
              curved shapes. These laminate types are chosen to craft rounded,
              curvaceous edges and structures on countertops and other furniture
              pieces.
              <br /><br />
              Digital Print Laminate <br />
              Digital print laminates allow for custom prints, designs, patterns
              and images to be digitally printed on the decorative layer and
              provide creative freedom and flexibility in design choices.
              <br /><br />
              Phenolic Backed Laminate <br />
